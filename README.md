# Stock Market Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a stock price prediction model using machine learning techniques in Python. The goal is to analyze historical stock market data and predict future stock prices based on patterns and trends. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of machine learning models
- Model evaluation and performance analysis
- Visualization of stock price trends

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Additionally, Jupyter Notebook is required to execute the `.ipynb` file:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the `Stock_Price_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning_in_Python.ipynb` file.
5. Execute the cells step by step to process the data and train the model.

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (if implemented)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical stock price data, including:
- Date
- Open Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Close Price
- Volume

Ensure that the dataset is available in CSV format before running the notebook.

## Results
- Predicted stock prices based on historical trends.
- Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- Graphical visualization of stock price trends and predictions.
